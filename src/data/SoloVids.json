One of my top 5 favorite movies of all time. \n\n\nThe trailer that exists for this is perfect, and one of my favorites. I tried my hardest to use material that wasn't in the original, but it was difficult. They were great with the usage of moments. You can find it here if you haven't seen it:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jit3YhGx5pU\n\nMaybe someday I'll make another one without cursing. Harder than I thought.\n\n\nfor business inquiries, check the \"about\" section on this channel.\n\nSoftware: Final Cut Pro X, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Logic Pro X\nMovie: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017)\n\n\nALTHOUGH ALL ELEMENTS OF THIS TRAILER WERE EDITED BY ME, I OWN NONE OF THE MUSIC OR MOVIES IN THIS VIDEO.

The search for the meaning of life and the [truth] (another themed video) in forms of fictional stories. I never say this in a description, but this video holds my favorite edit I have ever done in a Fargo video. this is 2:42 to 3:07. The shot of Sy came out exactly how I pictured, with the animation type coloring fading away before The Planet Wyh clip. You could probably catch on to the meaning I was going for, almost as a snap back into reality, but yeah, I loved it. Sorry if this is typed weird. I am tired as hell right now.

The search for the meaning of life and the [truth] (another themed video) in forms of fictional stories. I never say this in a description, but this video holds my favorite edit I have ever done in a Fargo video. this is 2:42 to 3:07. The shot of Sy came out exactly how I pictured, with the animation type coloring fading away before The Planet Wyh clip. You could probably catch on to the meaning I was going for, almost as a snap back into reality, but yeah, I loved it. Sorry if this is typed weird. I am tired as hell right now. Goodnight.\n\n\nSoftware: Final Cut Pro X\nSong: The Quality of Mercy - Max Richter\nShow: Fargo\n\n\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.

            "description": "Best Quality - 1080p\nHeadphones Recommended\n\n\nWes Anderson is probably my favorite director of all time. Every work of his is both hilarious, and deeply saddening, while also extremely childish and heartwarming. I think that \"childish\" theme plays a big factor since his films are undeniably adult-content, with a colorful cascade that differentiates itself to every film, making every work different, yet the same. His awkward and hilariously abrupt humor is probably my favorite feature of these. It's very real and EXTREMELY natural when it's presented. The dialogue obviously plays a big part in that, which leads me onto the fact that his use of dialogue is the best i've seen in film. Nothing is unnatural and it's very messy, but in a good way. Messy as in it's something you would say in your daily life, and almost as if there is no script. Grammar is used incorrectly from a child showing almost a struggle to communicate correctly, but perfectly saying what he wants to say through means of leaving behind a filter of correctness and structure. We are left with an emotion after these films end. That of which I can't really pinpoint.

The acting is actually what makes the season in my opinion.\n\nThe ending was fantastic! I had some small problems with it like the fate of Hanzee, and the finale was slightly dragged out, but if it wasn't for the final scene with the Solverson's, I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much as I did. It really leaves off on a positive, unexpected note. I ACTUALLY DID NOT KNOW THE EPISODE WAS GOING TO END THERE lol. It was very well done, I looked into Ted Danson's monologue at the end and found out how it sort of explains the entire season. It shows how almost all of the conflicts that occurred in the series were from miscommunication and misunderstanding. Look it up it's crazy.
