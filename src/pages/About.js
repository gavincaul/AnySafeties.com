        Meet Colton, an individual whose 
        passion for music is insufferably exorbitant, 
        centered around a unique taste that many might consider unusual. 
        Colton's heart beats in sync with the intricate electronic sounds
         and avant-garde compositions of Aphex Twin, an artist known for 
         pushing the boundaries of conventional music. While others may 
         scratch their heads at the unconventional beats and experimental 
         melodies, Colton ardently defends Aphex Twin's work as a musical 
         genius. Passionate to the point of exuberance, Colton enthusiastically 
         shares the intricate nuances of Aphex Twin's discography, often 
         leaving friends bewildered by the complex and abstract sonic 
         landscapes. Unfazed by the raised eyebrows, Colton stands proudly as 
         a fervent advocate for the electronic avant-garde, finding beauty 
         in the dissonance and chaos that others may perceive as challenging.
          In Colton's world, Aphex Twin's music isn't just a sound; it's a 
          captivating journey through the unexplored realms of sonic artistry.
